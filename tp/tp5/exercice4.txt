Given this code :
class Worker(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def work(self): pass
    @abstractmethod
    def eat(self): pass
    @abstractmethod
    def sleep(self): pass
    @abstractmethod
    def get_salary(self): pass
class Robot(Worker):
    Pass
    # Problem: Robots don't eat or sleep!
1.​ Analyze a bloated interface
2.​ Students split into cohesive interfaces: Workable, Eatable, Sleepable, Payable.
