Given this code :
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, amount, method):
        if method == "credit_card":
            # Process credit card
            pass
    elif method == "paypal":
        # Process PayPal
        pass
    elif method == "bitcoin":
        # Process Bitcoin
        Pass
1.​ What happens when adding new payment methods?
2.​ implement an abstract base class and concrete payment strategies using inheritance and
polymorphism.

1. changement dans la fonction:
    elif method == "new method"
        #process new method
        pass

2.
